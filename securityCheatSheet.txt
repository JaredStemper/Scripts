	#target validation
	#subdomains
		google-fu, dig, nmap, sublist3r, bluto, crt.sh
	#subdomains
	#fingerprinting
		nmap, wappalyzer, whatweb, builtwith.com, netcat
	#fingerprinting
	#databreaches
		haveibeenpwned, weleakinfo.com
	#databreaches
	#employee info
		weleakinfo.com is good for tying an employee who uses similar passphrases across websites
		hunter.io is good for finding the general pattern a company uses for emails
			e.g. {f}{last}@irobot.com

	#burpsuite 
		(pro)
		warning: if you manually create a number of users and create a number of logs/request, running an active scan against those requests will repeat those requests...
			this could easily lead to a number of spam users created or even a deleted database!
	#burpsuite 
	#nmap
		#ssl
			scan for ssl and look at the ciphers
			nmap -p 443 --script=ssl-enum-ciphers IPADDRESS
		#ssl
	#nmap
	#nikto
		vulnerability scanner
		nikto -h siteUrl
			should return initial results almost instantly, and then a super long time for the rest of the scan
		here's target IP, ssl cert info (wildcard certification is important), header info
		well known vuln scanning suite--which means it's highly likely for a WAF to detect/block it

		credential stuffing: using leaked info and spamming them to a bunch of different logins at different sites
		WAF (web application firewall): protects web applications by filtering/monitoring HTTP traffic between a web application and the Internet.
			typically protects web applications from attacks such as cross-site forgery, cross-site-scripting (XSS), file inclusion, and SQL injection, among others
			a protocol layer 7 defense, that is not designed to defend against all types of attacks

			While a proxy server protects a client machine’s identity by using an intermediary, a WAF is a type of reverse-proxy, protecting the server from exposure by having clients pass through the WAF before reaching the server.
			can be network-, host-, or cloud-based
				network:
					generally hardware based. installed locally, low latency. most expensive option since they require storage/maintenance
				host:
					pros: may be fully integrated into the app's software. less expensive than ^ and offers more customizability.
					cons: the consumption of local server resources, implementation complexity, and maintenance costs. 
						These components typically require engineering time, and may be costly.
				cloud:
					pros: cheap, easy to implement. sometimes as simple as a change in DNS to redirect traffic. consistently updated/maintained without any additional work
					cons: users hand over the responsibility to a third-party, therefore some features of the WAF may be a black box to them
